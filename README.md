We decided that, for our 3-Day project, we would make a console game version of Russian Roulette using silly string because we needed to make it "sChOoL-aPpRoPrIaTe". 

The project purpose is to practice the development process and make a fun little game (we did not achieve either of these purposes satisfactorily).

Using only the c# code in Program.cs, running "dotnet run" in the terminal will start the game and bring up the main menu. The game can be played with any amount of players greater than 1. Use the arrow keys in the main menu to change the amount of players. You could also press q to quit. Once you're ready, hit enter to play. The idea is that every player is given a can of silly string, but only one of them has anything in it. Player one is prompted to press any key to trigger the silly string. If their can is the one with stuff in it, they die from sillyness, and the game continues on with the remaining players having one new can reloaded with string. The next player is then prompted to trigger the can. This cycle repeats until one person is left non-sillyed - they are deemed the winner and the game returns to the title screen.
